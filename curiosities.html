                <h2>Geek References</h2>

                <p>The animation is widely known for its geek culture references, being rich in pop culture elements with 
                    various tributes to anime and video games. One of the most talked-about references is the concept 
                    of fusion, clearly inspired by Dragon Ball. Additionally, the series alludes to other anime, 
                    such as Sailor Moon, and games like Final Fantasy.</p>
